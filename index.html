    <p>
      I chose Michelle Obama for my monument because I am currently reading one of her books, 
      <em>Becoming</em>, and I find her life story very inspiring. Michelle Obama was the First Lady 
      of the United States from 2009 to 2017 during her husband, Barack Obama’s presidency. She is the 
      first African-American to serve as First Lady of the United States. Her appointment as First Lady 
      symbolizes progress for Black women and the wider African-American community. Michelle Obama also 
      started a campaign called “Let’s Move!”, which focuses on promoting healthy eating and physical 
      activity for children in order to create a healthier future. The campaign got over 520 elected 
      officials involved and impacted over 81 million Americans. Michelle Obama has volunteered in many 
      ways to benefit African-American communities throughout her life, including the NAACP Voter-Turnout 
      Partnership and empowering African-American girls. Even after her term as First Lady, Michelle 
      Obama continues inspiring people and helping out communities, having a great effect on the country 
      and, in particular, the African-American community.
